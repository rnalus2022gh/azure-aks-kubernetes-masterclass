***All demos have been tested against Ubuntu 18.04 and Kubernetes 1.20.1***

There may be slight differences in the code from what's in the video course, but the concepts are all the same.

If you have any issues please feel free to reach out.

In module 2, if you have a containerd based cluster use the file 1-etcd-containerd.sh. If your cluster is still on docker use the 1-etcd.sh file. The files are logically the same...just a few commands are different based on the container runtime in use.
